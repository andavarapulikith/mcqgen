       "{'text': 'Cellular Respiration in Eukaryotic Cells\\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic processes that occur within cells to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. It is a critical process for the survival of eukaryotic cells, encompassing a series of reactions that are classified into three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation.\\n\\nGlycolysis\\nGlycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. This process takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the conversion of one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon compound) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). Glycolysis can be divided into two phases:\\n\\nEnergy Investment Phase: Involves the expenditure of two ATP molecules to phosphorylate glucose and its intermediates.\\nEnergy Payoff Phase: Produces four ATP molecules and two NADH molecules by substrate-level phosphorylation.\\nThe net gain from glycolysis is two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules per glucose molecule.\\n\\nCitric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)\\nThe pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they are converted into acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle, a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions that are crucial for the cellular metabolic process. The main functions of the citric acid cycle include:\\n\\nThe complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide.\\nThe reduction of NAD+ and FAD to NADH and FADH2.\\nThe production of one ATP (or GTP) per cycle through substrate-level phosphorylation.\\nThe citric acid cycle generates three NADH and one FADH2 per acetyl-CoA molecule, which will be used in the next stage for ATP production.',\n",
